# Open Development Template

Workflow and documentation templates that help teams formalize their goals, workflow and governance model to encourage participation and field contributions.

## Goals

This project provides templates for project managers that aim to:

- makes it easy for newcomers to a project to get involved (creates an environment with a low barrier to entry)
- easy maintainability as a project grows

## Components

- **Objectives**: What are the goals of the project?
- **Governance**: How are decisions made in the project? What are the human or social rules that should be followed in the project? What is the social framework for collaboration in the project?
- **License**: What is the legal framework for collaboration in the project? How can I use the project?
- **Process**: How is work done in the project? How do we implement the project's Governance to give project contributors structure in how they do their work?
