# Contributing to Open Development Template

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how we expect
contributions to happen.

1. [Too Long; Didn't Read](#tl-dr)
2. [Getting Involved](#getting-involved)
3. [Governance](#governance)
4. [Communication](#communication)

## TL;DR

1. Start by searching [the issue tracker][issue-tracker] to see if your
   contribution, be it a problem or a suggestion for an enhancement, was brought
   up before.
2. If nothing satisfying comes up, feel free to [file a new issue][file-issue].
   Provide as many details about your idea, problem, or suggestion as possible.
3. Once a conversation with one or more established contributors has taken
   place, it should become clear when it is appropriate to suggest a change
   (via, for example, a pull request).
4. If you are a first-time contributor, you _do_ need explicit permission from
   at least one other established contributor before your changes can be accepted.

## Getting Involved

- [search our issue tracker for issues with the "help wanted" label][help-wanted]

## Governance

This project follows an open participation and [lazy consensus][lazy-consensus]
model. This means that:

1. anyone can chime in and get involved,
2. everyone involved seeks consensus, and
3. existing contributors do not require explicit permission from other contributors
   to proceed with their work - but do need to be prepared to rollback should
   objections arise from other contributors
