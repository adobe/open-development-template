# Why Document It?

## Efficiency Through Clarity Of Direction

It is easy to get caught up in the day-to-day trials and tribulations of work,
but how can we be sure that what we're working on aligns with the purpose of the
project? **A mission statement is a guiding star** or a lighthouse on the horizon
that gives us perspective and allows us to judge whether our work pushes the
project in the right direction. It [manages to align the behaviour of team members
at all levels without requiring play-by-play instructions from
leaders][what-mission]. This **allows for self-organization** to take over, because
teams are smart enough to figure out for themselves how to arrive where they are
needed - all we need to do is make clear where they are needed. This is also
helpful to [clarify priority][strategic-planning] amongst the plethora of tasks
in front of teams.

## Lowers Barrier To Entry

A clear mission statement lets other individuals and organizations have a snapshot
view of whom your group is and what it wants to do. When it is easily visible,
people can learn about your project without having to work hard for the information.
Then, those with common interests can take the time necessary to learn more. This
can be very helpful when you are [recruiting other people and organizations to join
in your effort][strategic-planning]. When people love what you're doing and can
express their own values by working with you, [they're much more likely to join
your cause][purpose].

## Creates A Sense Of Purpose

By rallying a team and project around a purpose we [encourage excellence in our
team and provide staying power within it][purpose]. Purpose becomes the reason
for involvement - not money or glory, which do not have the same staying power
as purpose.

# How To Document It?

This can be as light or as heavy as a team wishes. It could be as light as a one
or two sentence mission statement, or as heavy as a mission statement supported
by time-bound objectives that each define a few key results that is regularly
reviewed by the team as part of their [process](Process.md).

For a smaller project composed of a single software repository, you can
document this in the project's `README.md`, possibly as part as a dedicated
"Mission" or "Why?" or "Purpose" section.

For a large project composed of several software repositories, you may wish to
dedicate a section of your project website to document this.

# Example Mission Statements

- Fedora, RedHat's open source linux operating system, has a high level [mission
    statement][fedora-mission] additionally complemented by a [list of 12-18 month
    objectives that are time-bound to specific releases][fedora-objectives].
- [Ubuntu has a mission statement][ubuntu-mission].
- [GitLab's Strategy webpage][gitlab-strategy] is a wonderful example.
- [Apache CouchDB has an entire "Why?"][couchdb-why] section in their
    documentation.
- [Apache HTTP Server][apache-http]'s intro blurb provides a concise,
    one-sentence mission: "The goal of this project is to provide a secure,
    efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services observing the
    current HTTP standards."
